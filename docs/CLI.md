DOSA CLI
========
There are two DOSA CLI applications:

* DOSA build tool: `./dbuild`
* DOSA network tool: _moved:_ now in its own repository as `dosa-net`!

DOSA Build Tool
---------------
The DOSA build tool is your primary means of compiling & uploading to boards. It will allow you to:

* Configure your local environment dependencies
* Compile a production or debug build
* Upload/install via USB
* Deploy OTA assets
* Open a serial monitor on a USB port to listen to device logs

> Run `./build` for a command-line reference
